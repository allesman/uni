# Synthesis

**Cost & Depth**

The cost of a circuit is equal to the # of gates used.
The depth of a circuit is the maximum # of gates that a signal can pass through before reaching the output.

**Synthesis of a Half Adder via a Truth Table**

To synthesize a half adder we first need to define the outputs for every combination of input. 

| a b | s  c  |
| 0 0 | 0  0 |
| 0 1 | 1   0 | 
| 1 0 |  1  0 |
| 1 1  | 0  1  |

From this table we can derive that the formula for the sum of a half adder is simply the $\huge \oplus$ gate, and the formula for the carry is just the $\huge \land$ gate. Therefore we can derive that our circuit has one output that stems from each gate.
