# State of the Industry
- 28% of devs laid off
- Indie on the rise (Go for that, not AAA)

How Small Project is like Big Project
## Require organisation
## Phases of Development
### Pre-Production
- Prototype (**what** you're making (vision))
	- don't get perfectionist
- Vertical Slice (**how** you're making it)
	- have your pipeline
	- Calculate Speed per Game amount from that

Producer shouldnt do blocking things




> [!important] SHARED VISION
> Leadership less important, Vision!
> Return to vision during Dev, check if you still match it, maybe change vision
> Don't care about specifics, like how many characters etc.
